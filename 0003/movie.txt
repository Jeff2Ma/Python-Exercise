Fight Club: "It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything."  
  
We spend all of our lives trying to move up on an imaginary ladder.   
Even when we do succeed, we live in constant fear of falling off and hitting bottom,   
so it's still very agonizing - and not very fulfilling. By actually hitting bottom,   
it gives one unbelievable strength when the realization emerges that you have the ability to endure rock bottom.  
You understand that you have nothing to lose.  
  
This makes one virtually unstoppable from that point forth. You are free to do anything,  
to go anywhere, to try anything. No matter what you try, it doesn't matter if you fail.   
You've already lived through rock bottom and are still breathing.  
This is the only way to fully enjoy the journey for what it isã€‚
