A momentous sustainable development agenda, which charts a new era of sustainable development until 2030, was adopted on Friday by 193 UN member states at the UN Sustainable Development Summit at UN headquarters in New York.

"We have reached a defining moment in human history. The people of the world have asked us to shine a light on a future of promise and opportunity," said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at the opening ceremony of the summit.

"The true test of commitment to Agenda 2030 will be implementation. We need action form everyone, everywhere. Seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are our guide. They are a to-do list for people and planet and a blueprint for success," said Ban.
